**Kinabalu Coders** is a nickname for our more lengthy official name: *Persatuan Pengaturcara dan Pembina ICT Sabah (Sabah Coders and ICT Builders Association)*. An officially registered entity with the Malaysian Registrar of Societies in May 2014, we are run by a coalition of leads, organisers, and active participants of the open technology communities and technology-based development industries in Sabah. Kinabalu Coders provides a platform for open communities to engage together, with little constrain on formalities that many non-registered groups often face.

Our main goal is to increase the socio-economic standard of local communities using ICT and computerised applications. We also drive social awareness and expose up-to-date creative and innovative concepts conceived from the IT world; and strive to improve the overall proficiency of our local developer community.
